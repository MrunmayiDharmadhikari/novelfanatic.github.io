						<h1>War</h1>

					<p>War has been a dangerous tool in the growth of human society in various aspects such as political,economic,military,etc . This has been a horrifying catastrophe[claiming millions of lives with each war coming alive according to the chronology of armed conflicts whose origins can be traced back from simple rebellions to the current devastating terrorist civil wars in syria] which merely worsened when each conflict took place.</p>
					<p>Let us talk about all the sides of the major destructive outcome which always perceived insatiable
bloodshed and revenge yet never stopped or subsided. As J.R.R. Tolkien has rightly said - " War must be,
while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all, but I do not love the bright sword
for it's sharpness,nor the arrow for it's swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which
they defend.", in his famous trilogy the Lord of the rings; this writer summarizes the true essence of war
in a single paragraph thus shedding light as to the reasons behind his occurrence. The various causes of
war along with the common ones include- rebellion against the higher authority as successfully
illustrated by the Indians against the British rule or the French renaissance for instance. Another famous
source for wars is the demonstration of a country's superiority over it's fellow members as was observed
by the entire world in the two world wars fought in between different nations with such grotesque
consequences which we face even today and will continue to face in the future.</p>
					<p>This word "war" is defined in multiple ways thus highlighting the true nature of the people who dive into
the realms and political strategies of wars. For example, Adolf Hitler states " if you win,you need not
have to explain. If you lose,you should not be there to explain." whereas on the other hand another
leader has quoted that " when the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know
peace." are two sides of the same coin. The world has been ruled by many great men and women,some
highlight the necessity of war and talk about those who were willing to fight against the evil genius
enemy who threatened to destroy the civilization built by our forefathers to restore peace; whereas
some leaders believed that war must always be avoided as it results to pain and suffering.</p>
					<p>There is absolutely no need to review the effects of any such armed conflicts as the people have
themselves witnessed the barbaric acts of Hitler and Mussolini,the injustice of the British rule imposed
on its colonies,the American civil war which was fought to rebel against the continued act of slavery,and
the present on-going terrorist acts in Syria.</p>
					<p>In today's time,we wage a war with the negative half of the society which forces us to encounter acts
like drugs,abuse,sexual assault,terrorism along with many more though these are the prime domains
and pose a serious threat to the society. This isa necessary precaution to protect ourselves from the
harmful operations of the sadists.</p>
					<p>Wars should be condemned and looked down upon in order to establish peace and harmony in this
world and rid the world of evil and cunning masterminds who are still out there,bidding their time to
attack us and plunge the world into darkness of chaos.</p>
