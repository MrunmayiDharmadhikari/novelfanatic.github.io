					<p>Logic will get you from A to B, but imagination will make you fly in the limitless skies.</p>
					<p>Most of the people agree to the point that imagination is more important than knowledge. The popular Beethoven symphonies could never have come into existence at there been zero imagination on his behalf. Creativity is result of imagination and knowledge is the result of creativity. One of the most important inventions of mankind, the invention of wheel, can be viewed as the perfect example for this process. As man first saw the moving log of wood and eventually came up with the vehicle.</p>
					<p>The famous works of Leonardo Da Vinci have been speculated to contain astounding paintings which depict many of the present-day discoveries in that earlier age which tells us that his imagination knew no boundaries.</p>
					<p>While imagination plays a crucial role in any inventions/discoveries; without knowledge we are helpless. To convert a hypothesis into a proven principle, knowledge is the most important factor. Let's consider the example of a telephone. Graham Bell, who was the inventor of telephone, visualized the concept of telephone, but the picture that was painted in his mind wouldn't have come alive if he didn't know the theory of communication over long distances, and the science and technology behind it.</p>
					<p>Similarly, NASA or ISRO or any other space agency couldn't have achieved their goal of sending satellites into space of thy didn't have relentless scientists constantly mining the discoveries of our solar system and galaxy without the help of astrophysics and mathematics.</p>
					<p>Simply one can say that imagination and knowledge run hand in hand that is they are two sides of the same coin.</p>
