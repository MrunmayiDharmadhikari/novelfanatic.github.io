						<h1>Rain</h1>
						<p class="info">3 months ago by <a href="#">Mrunmayi</a></p>
					</header>
					<p>The water droplets falling from the skies, washing away the dark, bitter times of the earth and thus giving way to the warmth and radiance buried deep inside us.</p>
					<p>Some say the rain is the symbol of dark,sad and black moods..it brings unhappiness and negativity along with it but I disagree....For me..rain is the most beautiful form of nature...sometimes rain is accompanied by monstrous cyclones,storms and other natural disasters...even though they cause a huge loss to life and property; the beauty,power and strength portrayed by these "natural disasters" are phenomenal...it displays the strength of nature...it's ability to build and destroy...to aid people and  make them helpless....to maintain balance and to create chaos...</p>
					<p>Nature is the best teacher a man is provided with....it teaches us to improve ourselves,to become worthy of using the natural resources provided to us by mother earth,to learn to live in a very lively and simple way,to gain the knowledge of various occurrences of events which shape our lives.We acquire understanding of a number of talents hidden inside mankind by spending just a few minutes with nature...let it be at the beach with the roaring sound of the powerful sea and the waves crashing against the rocks of the beach or by the fire with its crackling sound in winters or on the top of a building where the endless and beautiful skyline is telling us a different story at every different moment or maybe in the midst of mountains where the blowing winds and the smell of fresh air and earth motivates us and brings a piece of calm and security...</p>
					<p>When it is raining it quenches the thirst of the land which makes way for the replenishment of crops,the rain cleanses our environment of pollution and provides us with fresh air to breathe in,it brings about hope,love and other tremendous amount of possibilities of gaining happiness.It brings about a positive character which is seldom seen in day to day life.When the rain stops the dark disturbing clouds vanish and the sun is reborn again to fill the earth with its sunlight thus painting the earth in the energetic colours of yellow,red and Orange.</p>
